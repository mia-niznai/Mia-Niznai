#Hi there!#

:kissing_heart:

I'm Mia, (freshly graduated) junior full-stack developer, with former experience in non-governmental (human rights) organizations, script supervising for movies and human resources.
I am aiming for a hybrid position in a creative tech organization.
My dream job would be in a company at the intersection between disciplines and technologies, with cross-disciplinary expertise and innovative projects with great impact for society. 

P.S.: You can also follow me at [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/MiaNiznai), where I'm trying to solve katas :).
